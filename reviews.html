	<h2> Intoduction</h2>
	<p>In Albert Camus’ “The Outsider”, Camus explores the absurd with its facets of the inherent meaningless of life and the inevitability of death. Through the passage which mocks the funeral procession of Meursault mother’s death, we see a stark contrast between Meusault focus on the “soft white roots mixed in the dirt” and the inescapable sun, noticeably not focusing on his mother indicating a distance between Meursalt and the actual function of the funeral, against his foil Prez who is giving “great tears of fear and pain” showing us his emphatic and emotional nature but this is undermined by the way Meursault describes his collapse in the blistering heat of the Algerian sun as “like a puppet”, puppet which has strong connotations with something childish or for whimsical entertainment like at a circus, is purposely used to make what ordinarily should be a heartbreaking moment something lighthearted creating an emotional disconnect in the reader, Camus does this to highlight the stupidity in carrying out this funeral in the burning evening which as highlighted in Mersult is a meaningless act further by the ending of the passage where Mersult comments that after the funeral all he could think about is the bus ride home and tonights sleep. Death is highlighted throughout the novel and the passage with its setting following Meursault trailing his mother's funeral carriage as it heads to the cemetery in the village. </p>
	<h3> Death </h3>
<p>. Death is highlighted throughout the novel and the passage with its setting following Meursault trailing his mother's funeral carriage as it heads to the cemetery in the village. We are constantly reminded of the mortality of human beings as Meursault highlights the age of Prez in his “many wrinkles” (further undermining any emotions we would have felt for him) and through the earth itself which Meursault notices is “the color of blood” while they bury Meursault’s mother’s corpse this creates an ever present tone of the mortality of people. The inevitability of death is again highlighted by the nurse who talks about the high heat remarking about how if you “walk to slowly… you risk getting a sun stroke. But if you walk to quickly… you’ll [will] catch a chill]” this paradox of two choices which both lead to a similar outcome is used as a metaphor for death by the novel highlighting the pointlessness of trying to find a meaning in life where death is inevitable, the very definition of the absurd.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>In the passage Camus explores the ideas of the absurd by creating a constant sense of death in the weather and setting and mocking the act of trying to work against this insurmountable force in the funeral convoy in this symbolic act of the absurd.</p>
